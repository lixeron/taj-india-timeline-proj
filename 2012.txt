On November 14, 2012, Taj India posted some of their first ever photos to social media on Facebook. These images were taken from a Happy Holi celebration showing people covered in colors with all of the unique Indian food provided during the event. It even shows the staff themselves covered in the bright colors as well. This was one of the first big event posts that Taj India shared showcasing their culture through social media with the people of Birmingham.
