Idea for timeline design:
Have a line at the top where the orange bar is that stretches horizontally that represents the timeline with 10 interactive dots on it.
Clicking on a dot will bring up the timeline and hovering over it will reveal the date.
When clicking on the dot it will bring up the timeline date description of that date as well as the time next to it (similar to our current format)
It will also have an image.
So instead of a scroll, it is more of an interactive thing so the user can skip/view anywhere they want to instead of scrolling to it.
I also still want the image/text to fade in when you click those dots and obviously fade out when another dot is clicked like we have now.
