On October 17, 2025, Sarah Vallie published a feature on Chowhound titled "The Hands Down Best Indian Restaurant in Every US State," and Taj India was chosen as the representative for Alabama. The article explains Taj India's history as the oldest Indian restaraunt in Birmingham praising its buffet and loyal customers. Although not receiving any physical representation of an award, the recognition for Taj India being on a national list of standouts among many Indian restaurants is a reward in itself. She also explains how Taj India has both North and Southern cuisines pointing out some of their best dishes being the tikka masala and the mango chutney. As a place that started out small under the name Royal Taj in 1986 moving to an area where Indian cuisine is unknown to now being named the best in the state under the name Taj India shows the impact and importance the restaurant is to Alabama's food scene and culture, especially towards Birmingham's culinary story as a whole.
