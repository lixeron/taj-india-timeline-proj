On January 23, 2003, Taj India had created their website having a simple layout with images of their food and details about their menu. The website contains many descriptions about the ingredients they use, the equipment used, a little bit of their origin, and plenty of images of the restaurant. This helped many Birmingham locals who were unsure about Taj India to understand more about them without having to directly go in person which allowed them to grow their business even further.
