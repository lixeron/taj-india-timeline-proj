Taj India’s origins trace back to 1986, when the owners operated under the name Royal Taj. This marked the introduction of Indian cuisine to Birmingham’s dining scene at a time when cultural food options were limited. The restaurant helped build early curiosity and appreciation for Indian flavors. As one of the first Indian establishments in the city, its presence laid the foundation for a growing community and increased interest in South Asian food culture.
