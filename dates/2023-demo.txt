In 2023, the redevelopment of the Highland Plaza that was discussed began to take action and a Birmingham Business Journal article by Illyshia Parker stated that Taj India is relocating. The owners chose to lease the former Bougue's space inside the Fire Station No. 22 on Clairmont Avenue. After almost 3 decades in the same plaza, moving was a big change however it shows that the restaraunt is loyal to staying in Birmingham with it's reputation. It is around this time, more changes began happening with Taj India with an entirely new website having higher quality images and visuals as well as delivery and ordering apps. The menu design is also a lot more sophisticated. All of these new changes shows a new chapter in Taj India's history while still retaining many of it's originality.
