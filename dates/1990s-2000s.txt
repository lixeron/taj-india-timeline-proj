Throughout the late 1990s and 200s, Taj India became a place to eat, for communities to gather, and became popular due to many of the events they hosted for the Birmingham community. Many families and groups would come to visit Taj India to try the new foods, enjoy the dining room's warm atmosphere, and became a big staple restaurant for Indian cuisine in Birmingham.
