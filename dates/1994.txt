On July 20, 1994, Manjeet and Kamal, originally from California, opened Taj India at 2226 Highland Avenue in the Highland Plaza shopping center. Their affordable $5.95 lunch buffet quickly became a draw for students, workers, and local residents. The approachable price point and friendly service played a major role in introducing Indian cuisine to Birmingham at a larger scale. This opening solidified Taj India as a welcoming gateway to Indian food in the city.
