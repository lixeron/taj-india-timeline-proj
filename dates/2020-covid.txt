With COVID creating a rough patch for many restaurant owners, Taj India made a Facebook post to reassure customers of the safety precautions they decided to implement to make everyone comfortable. The post describes their use of turmeric in their dishes being an antioxidant as well as lemon being a mild disinfectant, offering the ‘Finger Bowl’ upon entrance. They also followed simple protocols, such as keeping hand sanitizer throughout the restaurant and cleaning the surfaces that many people come in contact with.
